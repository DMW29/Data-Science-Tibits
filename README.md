# Data-Science-Tibits
Compilation of data science problems that found minimal resolution through internet searches. As a Data Scientist I am consistently presented with challenges that must be solved. I believe I am not the only one encountering these issues. I do, however, find that solutions to some of my specific problems are not found through internet searches. Worse yet, I find incorrect solutions. I recongnize that not finding solutions through internet searches could be user error. Regardless, I decided to post the solutions I created out here in my repository in the event that they make someone else's life a bit easier by allowing them to be successful with less brain damage :)
