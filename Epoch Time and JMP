I have a database that I often use that stores time in epoch format, a.k.a. Unix time. Here is a link to the history of this interesting concept --> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time. The very short version of the history of epoch time is that it represents the number of seconds since January 1, 1970, "The Unix time number is zero at the Unix epoch, and increases by exactly 86400 per day since the epoch. Thus 2004-09-16T00:00:00Z, 12677 days after the epoch, is represented by the Unix time number 12677 × 86400 = 1095292800. This can be extended backwards from the epoch too, using negative numbers; thus 1957-10-04T00:00:00Z, 4472 days before the epoch, is represented by the Unix time number -4472 × 86400 = -386380800." The issue I would like to discuss here presents itself when using epoch time in JMP. JMP does not readily present epoch time accurately as it will for other time formats we may encounter. These time formats include those found in MS Excel for example. It is necessary to know that JMP stores time as the number of seconds since January 1, 1904 to solve this problem. In order to get the correct time in JMP the difference in reference times between Unix time and JMP time must be accounted for. The number of seconds from January 1, 1904 to January 1, 1970 is 2082844800. When epoch time is 1423874657, the result is 2082844800 + 1423874657 = 3506716800 seconds. 

One example of this is here  Short Date( :Name( "01/01/1970" ) + :epoch time ), where :Name( "01/01/1970" ) is a column containing the number of seconds from January 1, 1970 which is added to the :epoch time column.

From here any JMP date/time format can be chosen as how to display for your individual purpose. The Short Date format displays the result as 02/14/2015. Happy Valentine’s Day!
